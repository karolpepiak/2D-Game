# 2D-Game
My 1st C++ window 2D game, all rights reserved ©

Day 1 
step 1/34 - creating basic window from scratch

Day 2
step 2/34 - changing the basic C++ window to SDL2 C++ window. Creating Game class and adding "render", "clean" and "update" functions. Setting render to swap 2 textures.
(no SDL2 or SDL2_image_2.0.1 folders due to the file uplaod limit)
Adding Release build.

Day 3
step 3/34 - Adding: 
- window resolution selection from the console
full-screen mode selection from the console
- rendering multiple objects at the same time
- scaling objects by resolution height

Day 4
Step 3/34 - fixed memory usage by rewriting functions, no more increasing memory usage. Added an increasing counter that influences player location.
